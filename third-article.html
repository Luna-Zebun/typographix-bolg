            <h1> categories of healthy foods</h1>
            <p>Healthy foods are those that provide essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals while being low in unhealthy fats, sugars, and additives. Here are some categories of healthy foods:</p>
            <p>▎1. Fruits and Vegetables
            • Fruits: Apples, bananas, berries, oranges, and avocados are rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and fiber. 
            • Vegetables: Leafy greens (like spinach and kale), broccoli, carrots, and bell peppers are packed with nutrients and low in calories.
            <br>
            ▎  2. Whole Grains
            • Foods like brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole wheat bread, and barley are excellent sources of fiber and help maintain stable energy levels.
            <br>
            ▎3. Lean Proteins
            • Meats: Skinless poultry (chicken and turkey) and lean cuts of beef or pork.
            • Fish: Fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines provide omega-3 fatty acids.
            • Plant-based proteins: Lentils, beans, chickpeas, tofu, and tempeh are great sources of protein and fiber.
            <br>
            ▎4. Nuts and Seeds
            • Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, flaxseeds, and pumpkin seeds are rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber.
            <br>
            ▎5. Dairy or Dairy Alternatives
            • Low-fat or non-fat yogurt, milk, and cheese provide calcium and protein. Plant-based alternatives like almond milk or soy yogurt can also be healthy options.
            <br>
            ▎6. Healthy Fats
            • Sources include olive oil, avocado, and fatty fish. These fats are beneficial for heart health when consumed in moderation.
            <br>
            ▎7. Herbs and Spices
            • Fresh herbs (like basil, cilantro, and parsley) and spices (like turmeric, ginger, and garlic) can enhance flavor without adding calories or sodium.
            <br>
            ▎Tips for Healthy Eating:
            <br>
            • Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
            <br>
            • Limit Processed Foods: Reduce intake of foods high in added sugars, sodium, and unhealthy fats.
            <br>
            • Balance Your Plate: Aim for a variety of food groups to ensure a balanced diet.
            <br>
            • Portion Control: Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating.
            <br>
            Incorporating a variety of these foods into your diet can help you maintain good health and prevent chronic diseases.
